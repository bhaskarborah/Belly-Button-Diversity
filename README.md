#   Bacteria-To-Beef-Analysis

## Overview of Project
Roza is a biological researcher in a prominent microbiology laboratory. There are bacterial properties, which synthesize protein to make any plant based meta substitute taste like beef. Not all the properties of bacteria are known. Roza has been assigned the task to study and analyze more about them. The organization has partnered with Improbable Beef to study the candidate species. Roza believes that bacteria present in some belly buttons of human beings can be used to synthesize the required protein. Samples have been collected from anonymous people who have been given an id number. The objective of this project is to build a dashboard for participants and fellow researchers to search results based on an id number.

# Bacteria-To-Beef-Summary

The dashboard created can be utilized to find out the feasible samples of bacteria which can be used to synthesize the required protein to make plant based meat substitutes taste like beef.
